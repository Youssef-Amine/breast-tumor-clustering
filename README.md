# breast-tumor-clustering
This project analyses breast tumors cells to discover trends and connections between certain features and diagnoses through unsupervised method (Clustering).

## Objectives
Exploratory data analysis to see the first connections between features
Reduce dimensionalty with a prinical component analysis (PCA)
Cluster tumors regarding the principal features detected with the PCA
Visualization of clusters in function of target feature diagnosis to see which types of tumors are more likely to be cancerous cells.
