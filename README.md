This project analyses breast tumors cells to discover trends and connections between certain features and diagnoses through unsupervised method (Clustering). 
---

## Objectives

- Find the simple connections between features with an Exploratory Data analysis
- Reduce dimensionalty trough a principal component analysis (PCA)
- Cluster data regarding the principal features 
- Visualize clusters in function of target feature diagnosis to see which tumors are more likely to be a cancer
