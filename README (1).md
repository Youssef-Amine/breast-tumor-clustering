# bank-loan-repayment
This project aims to predict bank loan repayment with classification alagorithms. 
 algoriths are used for modeling and a data visualization application with Sreamlit set to provide interactive insights.
## Objectives

- Analyze and preprocess records of loan applicants, with various attributes related to personal demographics, financial status, and loan details.
- Build Logistic regression and Random Forest models
- Evaluate models with Accuracy score, Confusion matrix and ROC-AUC to choose the best model
- Visualization application with Streamlit
